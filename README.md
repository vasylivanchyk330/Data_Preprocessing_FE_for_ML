The main objective: prepare data and deploy a suitable machine learning model to the data set.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The following steps are taken:
 - loading and basic inspecting the dataset
 - data set cleaning and creating additional features
 - identifying factors that influence house prices
 - finding a correlation between the feature to predict and other features
 - correlation plotting
 - feature scaling
 - analysis machine learning results
 - enhancing the chosen machine learning model
 - identifying what features after deploying the machine learning model affect the feature to predict the most 


Dataset:
 - housing


Imported libraries:
 - pandas
 - matplotlib.pyplot
 - numpy
 - seaborn
 - scipy.stats
 - sklearn.ensemble
 - sklearn.metrics
